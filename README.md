my wahi
=======

my wahi is a quick site I put together to run on Google App Engine. It allows users
to bookmark their favorite places by selecting them point-and-click style on a Google map,
without requiring a login. The code is originally derived from an earlier project I did
while learning OpenLayers.

The backend uses the [web.py](http://webpy.org/) framework, [Mako](http://www.makotemplates.org/)
templates and a [Geohash](http://mappinghacks.com/code/geohash.py.txt) module written by
Schuyler Erle. The frontend uses [OpenLayers](http://openlayers.org/) (of course),
[jQuery](http://jquery.com/), the jQuery [Cookie plugin](http://plugins.jquery.com/project/Cookie)
by Klaus Hartl and [Blueprint CSS](http://www.blueprintcss.org/).
